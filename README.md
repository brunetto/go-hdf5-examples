go-hdf5-examples
================

My go-hdf5 examples folder

## Motivation

I used HDF5 a lot during master thesis, now I need again something smart to store a lot of data.
I was interested in [protocol buffers](https://github.com/brunetto/go-protobuf-examples) because they seem easier, but they are not the right tool to handle GBs of data, so I am back with HDF5.
Now I mainly use Go, thus I need to understand HDF% in GO!:P
